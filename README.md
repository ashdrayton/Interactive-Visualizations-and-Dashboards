# Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboards

In this assignment I have demonstrated use of d3 to create visualisations exploring the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

With the use of d3 this assignment shows the data shown both through bubble charts as well as a bar chart with the appropriate infomation listed in a table of the bacteria found.
